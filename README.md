# Tchux OS

Tchux OS is a hobby operating system designed for x86_64 PCs.
I created this project as a personal challenge a way to explore how computers really work under the hood. I've always been curious about operating systems, and building one from scratch seemed like the perfect way to dive deep into low-level programming, memory management, and hardware interaction.

Let’s be honest though: I also started this because I had nothing better to do, and I figured spending countless hours debugging kernels would be more fun than scrolling aimlessly on my phone.
Tchux OS is not meant to revolutionize computing , but it’s a playground where I can learn, experiment, and maybe even surprise myself with what I can build.

Whether it turns into something usable or just remains a fun side project, one thing’s for sure: it’s already been a great ride.
